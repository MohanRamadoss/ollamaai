Below is a concise overview and flow diagram:

**High-Level Flow**  
1. **Docker Connectivity**  
   - Using 

checkDockerConnection()

 from 

dockeragent.ts

, the app verifies Docker availability. It retries a few times if needed.  
   - API calls (e.g., 

fetch('/docker-api/version')

) check Docker version compatibility.  

2. **AI Models & Selection**  
   - 

ModelSelector

 and 

ModelSelect

 allow picking models from the 

AI_MODELS

 list.  
   - The app orchestrates different AI models (LLMs) and can add more in the future.  
   - Fallback or multiple model selection is handled by combining user-chosen models.  

3. **Prompt Handling & Docker Operations**  
   - 

executeDockerOperation()

 in 

dockeragent.ts

 orchestrates Docker tasks (like building, running containers).  
   - Prompt techniques follow user input + config, forming requests for Docker or AI tasks.  

4. **UI Components**  
   - 

CodeEditor

 handles editing files or code.  
   - 

FileAttachment

 uploads Docker config files.  
   - 

DockerDisplay

 displays Docker execution results or errors.  
   - 

ContainerStatsDisplay

 shows container stats (CPU, memory, network, etc.).  
   - 

TokenCounter

 estimates tokens for LLM usage.
