The tool shows significant potential for both technical innovation and business value, making it a strong candidate for hackathon presentation. Its unique multi-model approach and enterprise focus differentiate it from existing solutions.


Below is a brief conceptual overview:

1. Users choose models, language, complexity, and provide a prompt.  
2. The app sends a generation request (with API parameters like temperature, topP, topK, maxTokens) to each selected model.  
3. The backend (generate.ts) assembles prompts using complexity templates, calls AI APIs, and reports progress.  
4. Each model’s output is displayed in MultiModelOutput, providing copy/download features.  
5. If a model fails, the code handles it gracefully (fallback if available).  
6. The CodeEditor and other components render generated code with syntax highlighting.

Flow diagram (simplified Mermaid):

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[User Form] --> B[GeneratePage submits data]
    B --> C[generateCode in generate.ts]
    C --> D[Invoke AI model APIs]
    D --> E[Return code or error]
    E --> F[MultiModelOutput displays results]
    F --> G[CodeEditor shows code]
```

Prompt technique:  
• Templates differ by complexity (basic, intermediate, advanced).  
• The chosen model and prompt are combined into an instruction set for a specialized AI output.  

Model handling:  
• Each model is called in parallel and tracked in “modelOutputs.”  
• If a model fails, its status is marked “failed”; others keep going.  

Innovation and potential:  
• Automates multi-model code generation and comparisons.  
• Offers deeper customization (complexity, language, advanced prompt params).  
• Could be used at hackathons for rapid prototyping.  

Value and problem statement:  
• Simplifies exploring AI-generated code from multiple models.  
• Addresses the need to quickly compare results or code solutions in one place.  
• Adds clarity with previews, progress tracking, and error handling.

#####################Ansible prompt 

Create an Ansible playbook for deploying a LAMP stack on RHEL8. 
The playbook should include roles for web server, database server, and application server. 
Ensure that the inventory is properly configured and that best practices are followed for security and performance. 
Validate the configuration by testing the website and database connectivity.




#############Ansible playbook

Create an Ansible playbook to automate the installation and configuration of a LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) stack on RHEL 9 systems. The playbook should:

- Install and configure the latest stable versions of Apache (httpd), MariaDB, and PHP
- Enable and start required services
- Configure basic security settings for MariaDB
- Set up proper SELinux contexts and firewall rules
- Verify service status after installation
- Create a default PHP test page
- Configure Apache virtual hosts
- Set appropriate file permissions and ownership
- Enable necessary PHP modules
- Implement basic security hardening measures
- Create database backup procedures
- Include proper error handling and idempotency checks
- Add handlers for service restarts when configurations change

Ensure the playbook follows Ansible best practices and includes appropriate comments and documentation.


###############################################

# Background Information 
The task at hand requires the creation of an Ansible playbook that automates the installation and configuration of a LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) stack on RHEL 9 systems. This playbook should be capable of performing multiple tasks including installing and configuring the latest stable versions of Apache (httpd), MariaDB, and PHP; enabling and starting required services; setting up proper SELinux contexts and firewall rules; verifying service status after installation; creating a default PHP test page; configuring Apache virtual hosts; setting appropriate file permissions and ownership; enabling necessary PHP modules; implementing basic security hardening measures; creating database backup procedures; including error handling and idempotency checks; adding handlers for service restarts when configurations change. The playbook should also follow Ansible best practices and include appropriate comments and documentation.
 
# Technical Requirements & Constraints 
1. The system to be configured is a RHEL 9 server.
2. Ansible version 2.9 or higher should be used. Python version 3.6 or later must also be installed on the control node.
3. All the tasks within the playbook should be idempotent, meaning that they can be run multiple times without changing the system's state after the first time it runs successfully.
4. The playbook should handle errors gracefully and provide appropriate error messages in case of failures. 
5. The playbook should also follow Ansible best practices such as using roles for better structure, modularity, reusability, and readability, proper use of variable files, and tags for easier task execution.
6. All tasks within the playbook must be commented clearly to make it easily understandable by other developers.
7. Appropriate documentation must be provided in the form of comments at each task level explaining what it does.
8. The generated playbook should not contain any hardcoded values, all values should come from variables or fact gathering done during runtime. 
9. The firewall settings for HTTP/HTTPS and MySQL should allow traffic only from the localhost interface to prevent external access.
10. For simplicity, we will assume that no existing configuration of Apache, PHP, and MariaDB exists on the system before running this playbook.
11. User interaction is not required during installation, all necessary inputs/selections should be defined in the Ansible variables or role defaults. 
 
# Expected Input/Output or Behavior 
The expected output of the playbook is a fully configured RHEL 9 system with a LAMP stack installed and running correctly. The configuration of Apache, PHP, and MariaDB will follow best practices for security and performance. The test page should be accessible via HTTP on the localhost interface, showing the default PHP information page.
 
# Error Handling Considerations 
All tasks in the playbook must have error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle failures. Appropriate error messages should be displayed when a task fails. In case of any critical failure that prevents the continuation of the playbook, ansible should stop and display an appropriate error message.
 
# Best Practices 
1. Use roles for better structure, modularity, reusability, and readability. 
2. Make use of variable files for easy management of variables.
3. Utilize tags for easier task execution.
4. Comment each task in the playbook to improve understanding and maintainability by others.
5. Write a detailed README file at the root level of your project folder detailing what the playbook does, how to run it, any prerequisites, etc.
6. Use handlers for service restarts after configuration changes to ensure services are restarted in case of any configuration change.
7. Make use of fact gathering and register tasks to dynamically obtain system information during runtime instead of hardcoding values. 
8. All tasks must be idempotent i.e., they should not have side effects if run multiple times without changing the system's state. This ensures that running the playbook a second time won’t undo changes made by the first run.
9. Follow security best practices like setting up proper file permissions, secure configurations and disabling unnecessary services. 
10. The code should be modular and reusable to promote better organization and maintainability. Use roles where possible to separate concerns and make tasks more manageable. 
11. Test the playbook thoroughly before deploying it to production systems. Make use of ansible's --check flag to simulate a dry run without making any changes to actual system state. 
12. Regularly update the playbook as per latest available packages and security updates from upstream vendors, like RHEL, Apache, PHP etc.

# Define timestamp for backup archive name
TIMESTAMP=$(date +%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M)

# Define list of directories to exclude from backup
EXCLUDE_DIRS=("/proc" "/sys" "/tmp" "/dev" "/run" "/mnt" "/media")

# Define compression algorithm and level
COMPRESSION="gzip"
COMPRESS_LEVEL=9

# Create timestamped backup archive in tar.gz format
tar -czf "$BACKUP_DIR/root-backup-$TIMESTAMP.tar.gz" -C / . --exclude-from "$EXCLUDE_DIRS"

# Verify backup integrity after creation
sha256sum "$BACKUP_DIR/root-backup-$TIMESTAMP.tar.gz" > "$BACKUP_DIR/root-backup-$TIMESTAMP.sha256"

# Save the backup to a specified destination directory
mv "$BACKUP_DIR/root-backup-$TIMESTAMP.tar.gz" "$BACKUP_DIR/root-backup-$TIMESTAMP.tar.gz"

# Include compression with optimal settings
COMPRESS_OPTIONS="--format=gzip --level=$COMPRESS_LEVEL"

# Display progress during backup
PROGRESS_INTERVAL=10
while true; do
  PROGRESS=$(fuser /proc/*/fd/* | wc -l)
  if [ $PROGRESS -gt 0 ]; then
    printf "\rProgress: %s%%" $((PROGRESS * 100 / PROGRESS_INTERVAL))
  else
    break
  fi
done

# Include error handling and logging
LOGFILE="$BACKUP_DIR/root-backup-$TIMESTAMP.log"
exec >> "$LOGFILE" 2>&1

# Add compression with optimal settings
tar -czf "$BACKUP_DIR/root-backup-$TIMESTAMP.tar.gz" -C / . --exclude-from "$EXCLUDE_DIRS" $COMPRESS_OPTIONS

# Display backup size and completion status
DU=$(du -sh "$BACKUP_DIR/root-backup-$TIMESTAMP.tar.gz")
echo "Backup completed successfully ($DU)"
```
This script uses `tar` to create a timestamped backup archive in tar.gz format, excluding unnecessary directories and using compression with optimal settings. It also includes error handling and logging to ensure the backup is saved to the specified destination directory and displays progress during the backup process.
