1) 

Implement the Code Assistant Agent with the current LLMs. Here's a practical breakdown:

1. Code Assistant Agent Flow:
```plaintext
User Project -> Context Analysis -> LLM Processing -> Intelligent Suggestions

a. Context Collection:
- Project structure analysis
- Code file parsing
- Dependencies scanning
- Recent code changes
- User preferences tracking

b. LLM Integration Points:
CodeLlama/DeepSeek -> Real-time suggestions
Granite Code -> Code improvements
CodeGemma -> Pattern recognition
Qwen -> Context understanding
```

2. Practical Implementation Example:
```typescript
// Agent workflow with existing models
const agentFlow = {
  contextAnalysis: {
    model: "deepseek-coder:33b",  // Best for understanding large codebases
    tasks: ["project structure", "code patterns", "dependencies"]
  },
  
  realTimeSuggestions: {
    model: "codellama:13b",  // Fast responses for real-time use
    fallback: "granite-code:8b"
  },
  
  codeImprovements: {
    model: "granite-code:20b",  // Better for optimization
    tasks: ["performance", "security", "style"]
  },
  
  patternLearning: {
    model: "codegemma",  // Good for learning patterns
    storage: "user preferences database"
  }
};
```

3. Challenges/Limitations:
- Real-time performance might be limited
- Context window size restrictions
- Model response time variations
- Memory management for large projects
- Maintaining consistent suggestions across models

4. Potential Solutions:
```plaintext
a. Performance:
- Implement caching for common suggestions
- Use lighter models for real-time tasks
- Batch processing for larger analyses

b. Context Management:
- Chunking large codebases
- Maintaining relevance scoring
- Progressive context loading

c. Model Coordination:
- Primary/fallback model pairs
- Task-specific model selection
- Response aggregation and filtering
```




I'll show how the Code Assistant Agent could work specifically for Ansible playbook development. Here's a practical example:

```plaintext
Code Assistant Agent Flow for Ansible Development:

1. Context Analysis:
   Input -> Analysis -> Suggestions -> Generation -> Validation

   a. Input Collection:
   - Project structure scanning
   - Existing inventory files
   - Current roles and tasks
   - Dependencies in requirements.yml
   - Variables across group_vars/host_vars

   b. Model Assignment:
   - DeepSeek-33B: Complex architecture analysis
   - CodeLlama: Real-time task suggestions
   - Granite-20B: Best practices validation
```

Practical Example Flow:

```yaml
# Example Input: User wants to create a web server setup
User Request: "Create an Ansible playbook for nginx web server with SSL"

# Step 1: Context Analysis (DeepSeek-33B)
Agent Actions:
- Scans project structure
- Identifies existing roles
- Checks for SSL certificates
- Analyzes security requirements

# Step 2: Real-time Suggestions (CodeLlama)
Generated Structure:
```
```yaml
project_structure:
  webserver/
    ├── inventory/
    │   └── hosts.yml
    ├── group_vars/
    │   └── webservers.yml
    ├── roles/
    │   ├── nginx/
    │   ├── ssl/
    │   └── security/
    └── site.yml
```

```yaml
# Step 3: Intelligent Completion (Granite-20B)
- name: Install and Configure Nginx with SSL
  hosts: webservers
  become: true
  roles:
    - role: nginx
    - role: ssl
    - role: security

  tasks:
    - name: Ensure nginx is installed
      ansible.builtin.package:
        name: nginx
        state: present

    - name: Configure nginx SSL
      ansible.builtin.template:
        src: nginx_ssl.conf.j2
        dest: /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
      notify: restart nginx

# Step 4: Real-time Validations
Agent Checks:
- Idempotency validation
- Security best practices
- Variable usage
- Handler presence
- Module syntax
```

Live Assistant Features:
```plaintext
1. Real-time Suggestions:
   - Task completion
   - Module parameter hints
   - Variable suggestions
   - Best practice alerts

2. Context-Aware Help:
   "Warning: SSL certificate path not defined in variables"
   "Suggestion: Add handler for nginx restart"
   "Best Practice: Use 'state: present' instead of 'installed'"

3. Code Quality Checks:
   - YAML syntax validation
   - Ansible-lint integration
   - Security scanning
   - Role dependency checks
```

The agent continuously learns from:
1. User acceptances/rejections
2. Common patterns in the project
3. Best practices from Ansible documentation
4. Security recommendations
5. Error patterns

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of this flow?

- Project structure analysis
- Code pattern recognition
- Best practices detection
- Security analysis
- Performance optimization





const { GoogleGenerativeAI } = require("@google/generative-ai");

const genAI = new GoogleGenerativeAI("YOUR_API_KEY");
const model = genAI.getGenerativeModel({ model: "gemini-pro-code" });

async function countTokens(text) {
  try {
      const response = await model.countTokens(text);
      return response.totalTokens;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error counting tokens:", error);
    return null
  }
}

const yourPrompt = "Your code prompt or text here...";
countTokens(yourPrompt)
  .then((tokens) => {
      console.log("Number of tokens:", tokens);
  })


Model Selection: Consider using gemini-1.5-pro or gemini-1.5-flash when you have very long prompts or code.

In summary, while gemini-pro-code has a token window of 32,768, you'll want to be aware of the context limits of the model you are using and plan accordingly. Use token counting functions and context-management techniques for optimal results with code generation tasks.
