The tool shows significant potential for both technical innovation and business value, making it a strong candidate for hackathon presentation. Its unique multi-model approach and enterprise focus differentiate it from existing solutions.


Below is a brief conceptual overview:

1. Users choose models, language, complexity, and provide a prompt.  
2. The app sends a generation request (with API parameters like temperature, topP, topK, maxTokens) to each selected model.  
3. The backend (generate.ts) assembles prompts using complexity templates, calls AI APIs, and reports progress.  
4. Each model’s output is displayed in MultiModelOutput, providing copy/download features.  
5. If a model fails, the code handles it gracefully (fallback if available).  
6. The CodeEditor and other components render generated code with syntax highlighting.

Flow diagram (simplified Mermaid):

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[User Form] --> B[GeneratePage submits data]
    B --> C[generateCode in generate.ts]
    C --> D[Invoke AI model APIs]
    D --> E[Return code or error]
    E --> F[MultiModelOutput displays results]
    F --> G[CodeEditor shows code]
```

Prompt technique:  
• Templates differ by complexity (basic, intermediate, advanced).  
• The chosen model and prompt are combined into an instruction set for a specialized AI output.  

Model handling:  
• Each model is called in parallel and tracked in “modelOutputs.”  
• If a model fails, its status is marked “failed”; others keep going.  

Innovation and potential:  
• Automates multi-model code generation and comparisons.  
• Offers deeper customization (complexity, language, advanced prompt params).  
• Could be used at hackathons for rapid prototyping.  

Value and problem statement:  
• Simplifies exploring AI-generated code from multiple models.  
• Addresses the need to quickly compare results or code solutions in one place.  
• Adds clarity with previews, progress tracking, and error handling.
