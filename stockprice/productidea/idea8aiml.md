   - Optionally select predefined examples.

2. **State Management:**
   - 

AimlGeneration

 component manages application state.

3. **API Call:**
   - On generate action, 

generateAIML

 is invoked with parameters.
   - Progress is tracked and updated in the UI.

4. **Output Handling:**

# Conclusion

aicodecrat offers a comprehensive toolkit for AI/ML code generation, emphasizing flexibility, efficiency, and user-centric design. Its unique integration of multiple selectors and real-time feedback mechanisms positions it as a valuable tool for developers and organizations aiming to leverage AI technologies effectively.


Below is an outline of how the application works and how it delivers AI/ML code generation:

---

## High-Level Flow
1. The user selects a model (AIMLModelSelector), language (AIMLLanguageSelector), task (AIMLTaskSelector), and complexity level (ComplexitySelector).  
2. The user can also pick from predefined example prompts (AIMLExamples).  
3. When the user clicks “Generate,” the generateAIML function (in /lib/api/aiml.ts) is invoked. It receives parameters (model, language, task, complexity, prompt) and returns generated code.  
4. AIMLOutput displays the resulting code, handles download/copy, and shows progress or errors.

```mermaid

    A[User Interface] --> B(Select Model, Language, Task, Complexity)
    B --> C(AIMLExamples / Manual Prompt)
    C --> D(Click Generate)
    D --> E[generateAIML API Call]
    E --> F[Receive Generated Code]
    F --> G(AIMLOutput: Displays Code)
```

---

## API Interaction
• The “generateAIML” function simulates the model call and streams progress updates back to the frontend.  
• No built-in fallback mechanism is evident. It tries once, returns code, or returns an error.  

---

## Prompt Techniques
• The prompt is a text string combining user inputs (model, language, task, complexity, custom or example prompt).  
• The function merges these pieces into a final request sent to the back end.  

---

## Notable Features
• Dynamic complexity selection (basic, intermediate, advanced).  
• Multiple model options for varied capabilities.  
• Easy swap among tasks (training, evaluation, deployment, etc.).  
• Quick examples for faster setup.  

---

## Innovation & Value
• It orchestrates large language models in a user-friendly, front-end environment.  
• Potential to handle SQL or other specialized tasks.  
• Could save time and standardize AI/ML development (ROI).  
• Focuses on bridging skill gaps—ideal for hackathons, demonstrates cross-team collaboration.  
• Unique angle: flexible setup (model/task/complexity) in one place, helping solve code generation and pipeline creation problems.  

---

## Problem Statement & Opportunity
• Many developers struggle to integrate LLM-based code generation for AI/ML tasks.  
• This tool offers a guided approach: consistent prompts, example-driven workflows, and real-time progress.  
• Opportunity: lowers the barrier to complex AI/ML coding and supports faster prototyping.  

---

## Strategic Impact & Innovation Factor
• Speeds up internal development and fosters innovation with quick code generation.  
• Could be pitched in a hackathon as it highlights advanced AI usage with minimal overhead.  
• Similar tools exist, but the tight integration of complexity levels and tasks in one interface makes it stand out.
