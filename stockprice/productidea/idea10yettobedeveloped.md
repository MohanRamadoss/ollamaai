## Model Handling & Fallback Mechanism

The system implements a sophisticated model handling approach with robust fallback mechanisms:

1. **Primary Models**
   - Gemini Pro Code
   - CodeLlama
   - DeepSeek Coder
   - Granite Code

2. **Fallback Configuration**
   ```typescript
   {
     "codellama": {
       fallbacks: ["codellama:13b", "codegemma"],
       timeout: 30,
       temperature: 0.7
     },
     "llama3.3:latest": {
       fallbacks: ["llama3.2:latest", "codellama"],
       timeout: 30,
       temperature: 0.3
     }
   }
   ```
