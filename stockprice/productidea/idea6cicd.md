### **aicodecrat - Code Analysis and Documentation**

---

#### **1. Code Overview**

**aicodecrat** is an LLM orchestrator toolkit designed as a CI/CD tool. It leverages multiple models to generate CI/CD pipeline configurations based on user requirements, platform selection, and pipeline type.

---

#### **2. Code Flow and Process**

1. **User Interaction:**
   - Users select CI/CD platforms (e.g., GitHub, GitLab) and pipeline types (build, test, deploy, monitor) via the UI components (

CICDControl.tsx

, 

ModelMultiSelect.tsx

).
   - Users specify requirements and complexity levels using 

ComplexitySelector.tsx

.

2. **API Request:**
   - The front-end components gather user inputs and send a 

CICDRequest

 to the backend API (

generateCICDPipeline

 in 

pipeline.ts

).

3. **Pipeline Generation:**
   - 

getPipelinePrompt

 constructs a prompt based on platform, pipeline type, requirements, and complexity.
   - Models (`Ollama`, `Gemini`) generate pipeline configurations using the constructed prompt.
   - Progress is tracked and updated via 

CICDProgress

.

4. **Response Handling:**
   - Generated configurations, explanations, best practices, security checks, and automation steps are sent back to the front-end.
   - UI components (

MultiModelOutput.tsx

, 

CICDOutput.tsx

) display the results.

5. **Error Handling:**
   - 

CICDErrorBoundary.tsx

 captures and displays any errors during the process, allowing users to retry.

  - Returns a collection of 

CICDGenerationResult

 for each model.

---

#### **4. Prompt Techniques**

- **Dynamic Prompt Construction:** Combines platform-specific, pipeline type-specific, and complexity guidelines to tailor prompts.
- **Structured Response Expectations:** Instructs models to include code, explanations, best practices, security checks, and automation steps.
- **Markdown Formatting:** Requests responses in markdown for organized sections.

---

#### **5. Model Handling and Fallback Mechanism**

- **Multiple Models Support:** Utilizes models like `Ollama` and `Gemini` to generate configurations.
- **Progress Tracking:** Monitors each model's generation status via 

CICDProgress

.
- **Retries and Fallbacks:** Implements retry logic for failed generations, ensuring robustness.
- **Result Aggregation:** Collects successful outputs and handles cases where all models fail gracefully.

---

Below is a concise review.

### Plan
1. Gather user inputs (platform, pipeline type, complexity, models).  
2. Construct prompts via 

getPipelinePrompt(...)

 in 

pipeline.ts

.  
3. Call 

generateCICDPipeline(...)

 in `cicd.ts-1`, which:  
   - Builds a prompt.  
   - Invokes either 

generateWithOllama

 or 

generateWithGemini

.  
   - Extracts code/explanation/best practices.  
   - Updates progress state for each model.  
   - Retries on failure, providing a fallback mechanism.  
4. Display progress/UI in React components (

ModelProgressBar

, 

MultiModelOutput

, etc.).  
5. Render final pipeline code in the editor (

CICDOutput

).
