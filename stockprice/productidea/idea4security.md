Below is a concise breakdown and a simple flow diagram.

## Overall Flow and Architecture
The app reads user-provided code (FileAttachment component), allows selection of models and scan types (ModelSelector), then orchestrates security scans (scanSecurity in security.ts). Results are shown in various components (e.g., SecurityProgress, MultiModelOutput, SecuritySummary). The TokenCounter helps track LLM token usage.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[User Uploads Code] --> B[FileAttachment Reads Content]
    B --> C[User Chooses Models & Scan Type]
    C --> D[scanSecurity API Call]
    D --> E[Multi Model Analysis & Progress]
    E --> F[Security Results Displayed]
```

1. **Security Scan Process**  
   - The user picks at least one model (e.g., “Mistral Small,” “Granite Code 8B”).  
   - Source code is read into the system.  
   - The scanSecurity function composes prompts (prompt techniques: targeted security questions, relevant categories) for each model, dispatches to them, and aggregates their responses.

2. **API and Prompt Usage**  
   - The “prompt” logic tailors the code analysis instructions depending on language, scanType (“quick,” “full,” “deep”), and chosen categories (e.g., injection, broken access).  
   - The prompts pass code context, security guidelines, and any special checks.  
   - The API processes each model’s response. If a model fails, the tool can handle it gracefully by continuing with other models.

3. **Model Handling & Fallback**  
   - Each model is defined via SECURITY_MODEL_CONFIGS, specifying capabilities, parameters, and any fallback.  
   - If one fails, the orchestrator can still derive partial results from remaining models.  
   - Multi-model scanning helps cross-verify issues.

4. **Innovation and Strategic Value**  
   - Combines LLM-based scanning with a multi-model approach for robust coverage.  
   - Helps developers catch vulnerabilities earlier, potentially reducing costly breaches.  
   - The ROI is measured by time saved and reduced security incidents.  
   - For a hackathon, it’s innovative because it orchestrates multiple specialized LLMs. Competitive solutions often use a single engine; this leverages fallback and specialized scanning.

5. **Problem Statement and Opportunity**  
   - Many security tools don’t integrate dynamic LLM-based scanning or multi-model fallback.  
   - This solution addresses modern code threats by quickly adapting to new vulnerabilities via updated LLM models.  
   - The unrealized opportunity is to harness multiple advanced models for deeper scanning, bridging gaps in traditional static analysis.

6. **Unique Feature**  
   - Combining multiple specialized LLMs for code security.  
   - Fine-grained insight into potential issues with advanced prompt designs.

7. **Strategic Impact & Innovation Factor**  
   - Lower resource overhead by highlighting relevant security categories first.  
   - The multi-model synergy offers deeper coverage than single-model solutions.  
   - Helps organizations reduce security risks, track improvements, and fosters a more proactive security stance.

Overall, “aicodecrat” provides an orchestrated LLM security scanning toolkit that can bring measurable ROI by preventing vulnerabilities earlier, making it a strong contender for hackathon presentation.
